## 🚀 Live release environments

- [Open Sauced](https://opengraph.opensauced.pizza)

## 📖 Prerequisites

In order to run the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:
- `node>=18.15.0`
- `npm>=9.6.3`
- `docker>=20.10.23`

## 🖥️ Local development

To install the application:

```shell
npm ci
```

To start a local copy of the app on port `3001`:

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

### 📝 Environment variables

Some environment variables are required to run the application. You can find them in the `.env.example` file. While most of them are optional, some are required to run the application.

Boilerplate, changed mostly locally:

```dotenv
# Global env
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=3003
SERVICE_DOMAIN=opensauced.pizza

# GitHub private access tokens
GITHUB_PAT_USER=ghp_************************************
```

### 🎨 Code linting

To check the code and styles quality, use the following command:

```shell
npm run lint
```

This will also display during development, but not break on errors.

To fix the linting errors, use the following command:

```shell
npm run format
```

It is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.

### 📕 Types

We have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.

In order to dry run what types would be added to `package.json`:

```shell
npm run types:auto-check 
```

In order to add any missing types to `package.json`:

```shell
npm run types:auto-add
```

### 🚀 Production deployment

A production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.

```shell
npm run build
```
