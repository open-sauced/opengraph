contribution\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n🚀 Live release environments\nProduction (main)\n\nopengraph@digital-ocean.app\nopengraph.opensauced\n\nBeta (beta)\n\nopengraph-beta@digital-ocean.app\nbeta.opengraph.opensauced\n\n📖 Prerequisites\nIn order to run the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:\n\n node>=18.15.0\n npm>=9.6.3\n docker>=20.10.23\n\n🖥️ Local development\nTo install the application:\nnpm ciTo start a local copy of the app on port 3001:\nnpm run start:dev📝 Environment variables\nSome environment variables are required to run the application. You can find them in the .env.example file. While most of them are optional, some are required to run the application.\nOne can reverse engineer the named configs but some need a little explanation.\nBoilerplate, changed mostly locally:\n# GitHub private access tokens\nGITHUB_PAT_USER=ghp_************************************\n\n# DigitalOcean Spaces through aws-sdk configuration\nDO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY_ID=********************\nDO_SPACES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=*******************************************Ping @open-sauced/maintainers to get the dev CDN keys for the DO_SPACES_* variables.\nOther Digital Ocean S3 variables are sensibly set to default for local development, here are the defauls:\nDO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=digitaloceanspaces.com\nDO_SPACES_REGION=sfo3\nDO_SPACES_BUCKET_NAME=opengraph-devIt is also advised to set the following variables to true to avoid using the cached CDN during development:\nDO_SPACES_CDN_DISABLED=trueIf using a custom domain, you can set the following variable to the domain name:\nDO_SPACES_SUBDOMAIN=beta.opengraph-cdn.opensauced.pizzaOther API defaults you can change are not required in local development, but can sometimes appear configured differently for production:\nAPI_HOST=0.0.0.0\nAPI_PORT=3005\nAPI_DOMAIN=opengraph.opensauced.pizza\nMEMORY_HEAP=200\nMEMORY_RSS=3000\nDISK_PERCENTAGE=0.7\nDISK_SIZE=100🎨 Code linting\nTo check the code and styles quality, use the following command:\nnpm run lintThis will also display during development, but not break on errors.\nTo fix the linting errors, use the following command:\nnpm run formatIt is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.\n📕 Types\nWe have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.\nIn order to dry run what types would be added to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-check In order to add any missing types to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-add🚀 Production deployment\nA production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.\nnpm run build🤝 Contributing\nWe encourage you to contribute to Open Sauced!
