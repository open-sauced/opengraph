contribution\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n🚀 Live release environments\n\nDigital Ocean\nOpen Sauced\n\n📖 Prerequisites\nIn order to run the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:\n\nnode>=18.15.0\nnpm>=9.6.3\ndocker>=20.10.23\n\n🖥️ Local development\nTo install the application:\nnpm ciTo start a local copy of the app on port 3001:\nnpm run start:dev📝 Environment variables\nSome environment variables are required to run the application. You can find them in the .env.example file. While most of them are optional, some are required to run the application.\nBoilerplate, changed mostly locally:\n# Global env\nAPI_HOST=0.0.0.0\nAPI_PORT=3003\nSERVICE_DOMAIN=opensauced.pizza\n\n# GitHub private access tokens\nGITHUB_PAT_USER=ghp_************************************🎨 Code linting\nTo check the code and styles quality, use the following command:\nnpm run lintThis will also display during development, but not break on errors.\nTo fix the linting errors, use the following command:\nnpm run formatIt is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.\n📕 Types\nWe have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.\nIn order to dry run what types would be added to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-check In order to add any missing types to package.json:\nnpm run types:auto-add🚀 Production deployment\nA production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.\nnpm run build🤝 Contributing\nWe encourage you to contribute to Open Sauced! Please check out the Contributing guide for guidelines about how to proceed.\n\n\n🍕 Community\nGot Questions?
